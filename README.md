### Overview

Shoot the Moon is a stylized single-player pong-like game created using PhaserJs. Players play against the computer and try to score points by getting the ball (or moon) past the non-player character. The first player to 7 points wins.
 
I first undertook this project as a part of a MintBean hack-a-thon but was not able to finish on time. I have continued this project so that I can successfully complete the creation of a game and practice JavaScript using a unique framework.
 
 The assets in the game were created using a variety of asset-packs availabe on [itch.io](https://www.itch.io), a website focused on the creation and curation of indie games.
 
 ### Controls
 
Players control the paddle on the left-hand side of the screen (Player 1) and move up and down using the W and S keys respectively.

## Technical Requirements

### Technologies Used

1. JavaScript - the primary language that the program is written-in
2. HTML - used to construct the web-page thatt houses the game

### Dependencies

1. PhaserJS - the game engine that is used to create the graphics, physics, and other necessary states to run the game
